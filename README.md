# tabletop-island

this is my first website
i've created it while learning JS, HTML and CSS

- index.html is the main page (Home), mypage.js contains simple jQUERY scripts for chained hide/show and an animation

- myfavgames.html (My Favourite Games on index.html) has few additional fuctions 
	favgames.js contains scripts for:
 		clickable hearts for likes, 
		comments section at the bottom
		Clickings on paragraphs with games descriptions sends them to saved for later page. link to that page is below comments section.
