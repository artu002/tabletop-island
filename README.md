This is my first website.
I've created it while learning JS, HTML and CSS.

The website is about my hobby - board games.

Content:

- index.html is the main page (Home), it contains links to My Favourite Games and Gallery pages.
	mypage.js contains simple jQUERY scripts for chained hide/show and an animation.

- myfavgames.html (My Favourite Games on index.html) lists my 5 favourite games.
	This page has few additional fuctions. 
	favgames.js contains scripts for:
 		- clickable hearts for likes, 
		- comments section at the bottom
		- clickings on paragraphs with games descriptions sends them to saved for later page. link to that page is below comments section.
		
- gallery.html presents pictures of some board games I have played.
